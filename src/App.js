  "The happiness of my existence, its unique character perhaps, consists in its fatefulness.",
  "All the morbid disturbances of the intellect, even that semi-stupor which accompanies fever, have, unto this day, remained completely unknown to me.",
  "My circulation is slow. No one has ever been able to detect fever in me.",
  "To be one's enemy's equal-this is the first condition of an honourable duel. Where one despises one cannot wage war.",
  "Where one commands, where one sees something beneath one, one ought not to wage war. My war tactics can be reduced to four",
  "Nietzsche's spiritual death, like his whole life, was in singular harmony with his doctrine : he died suddenly and proudly,-sword in hand.",
  "War, which he and he alone among all the philosophers of Christendom-had praised so whole-heartedly, at last struck him down in the full vigour of his manhood.",
  "A man either is, or is not, aware of his significance and of the significance of what he has accomplished, and that if he is aware of it, then self-realisation, even of the kind which we find in these pages, is neither morbid nor suspicious, but necessary and inevitable.",
  "Only nobodies are ever modest.",
  "The object of the work [Ecce Homo] to be to dispose of all discussion, doubt, and inquiry concerning his own personality, in order to leave the public mind free to consider merely 'the things for the sake of which he existed'.",
  "Nietzsche's honesty in these pages is certainly one of the most remarkable features about them.",
  "Everything comes straight from the shoulder, without hesitation, without fear of consequences, and, above all, without concealment.",
  "'Everything decisive in this question I kept to myself-I have loved Wagner' (p. 122).",
  "The most striking thing of all, the miracle, so to speak, of this autobiography, is the absence from it of that loathing, that suggestion of surfeit, with which a life such as the one Nietzsche had led, would easily have been foreseen.",
  "Nietzsche's sensorium, as his autobiography proves, was probably the most delicate instrument ever possessed by a human being.",
  "Not that Nietzsche went mad so soon, but that he went mad so late is the wonder of wonders.",
  "We are no longer in the nineteenth century. We have learned many things since then, and if caution is only one of these things, at least it will prevent us from judging a book such as this one, with all its apparent pontifical pride and surging self-reliance, with undue haste, or with that arrogant assurance with which the ignorance of 'the humble' and 'the modest' has always confronted everything truly great.",
  "I am a disciple of the philosopher Dionysus, and I would prefer to be even a satyr than a saint.",
  "How much truth can a certain mind endure; how much truth can it dare?-these questions became for me ever more and more the actual test of values.",
  "Error (the belief in the ideal) is not blindness; error is cowardice.",
  "Every conquest, every step forward in knowledge, is the outcome of courage, of hardness towards one's self, of cleanliness towards one's self.",
  "I do not refute ideals; all I do is to draw on my gloves in their presence.",
  "Nitimur in vetitum; with this device my philosophy will one day be victorious; for that which has hitherto been most stringently forbidden is, without exception, Truth.",
  "In my lifework, my Zarathustra holds a place apart.",
  "With it, I gave my fellow-men the greatest gift that has ever been bestowed upon them.",
  "This book, the voice of which speaks out across the ages, is not only the loftiest book on earth, literally the book of mountain air,-the whole phenomenon, mankind, lies at an incalculable distance beneath it, but it is also the deepest book, born of the inmost abundance of truth; an inexhaustible well, into which no pitcher can be lowered without coming up again laden with gold and with goodness.",
  "Here it is not a 'prophet' who speaks, one of those gruesome hybrids of sickness and Will to Power, whom men call founders of religions.",
  "The most silent words are harbingers of the storm; thoughts that come on dove's feet lead the world.",
  "No fanatic speaks to you here; this is not a 'sermon'; no faith is demanded in these pages.",
  "From out an infinite treasure of light and well of joy, drop by drop, my words fall out-a slow and gentle gait is the cadence of these discourses.",
  "Such things can reach only the most elect; it is a rare privilege to be a listener here; not every one who likes can have ears to hear Zarathustra.",
  "'Alone do I now go, my disciples! Get ye also hence, and alone! Thus would I have it.'",
  "'Verily, I beseech you: take your leave of me and arm yourselves against Zarathustra! And better still, be ashamed of him! Maybe he hath deceived you.'",
  "'The knight of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but also to hate his friends.'",
  "'The man who remaineth a pupil requiteth his teacher but ill. And why would ye not pluck at my wreath?'",
  "'Ye honour me; but what if your reverence should one day break down? Take heed, lest a statue crush you.'",
  "'Ye say ye believe in Zarathustra? But of what account is Zarathustra? Ye are my believers but of what account are all believers?'",
  "'Ye had not yet sought yourselves when ye found me. Thus do all believers; therefore is all believing worth so little.'",
  "'Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when ye have all denied me will I come back unto you.'",
  "ON this perfect day, when everything is ripening, and not only the grapes are getting brown, a ray of sunshine has fallen on my life.",
  "I looked behind me, I looked before me, and never have I seen so many good things all at once.",
  "Not in vain have I buried my four-and-fortieth year to-day; I had the right to bury it—that in it which still had life, has been saved and is immortal.",
  "The first book of the Transvaluation of all Values, The Songs of Zarathustra, The Twilight of the Idols, my attempt to philosophise with the hammer-all these things are the gift of this year, and even of its last quarter.",
  "How could I help being thankful to the whole of my life? That is why I am now going to tell myself the story of my life.",
  "The overcoming of pity I reckon among the noble virtues.",
  "To remain one's own master in such circumstances, to keep the sublimity of one's mission pure in such cases,-pure from the many ignoble and more short-sighted impulses which come into play in so-called unselfish actions, this is the rub, the last test perhaps which a Zarathustra has to undergo-the actual proof of his power.",
  "In yet another respect I am no more than my father over again, and as it were the continuation of his life after an all-too-early death.",
  "My humanity is a perpetual process of self-mastery.",
  "But I need solitude-that is to say, recovery, return to myself, the breathing of free, crisp, bracing air. . . . The whole of my Zarathustra is a dithyramb in honour of solitude, or, if I have been understood, in honour of purity.",
  "The loathing of mankind, of the rabble, was always my greatest danger.",
  "Did my very loathing forge me wings and the strength to scent fountains afar off? Verily to the loftiest heights did I need to fly, to find once more the spring of joyfulness.",
  "Summer have I become entirely, and summer noontide!",
  "'A summer in the loftiest heights, with cold springs and blessed stillness: oh come, my friends, that the stillness may wax even more blessed!'",
  "'For this is our height and our home: too high and steep is our dwelling for all the unclean and their thirst.'",
  "'ye shall not think!' . . . I am much more interested in another question,-a question upon which the 'salvation of humanity' depends to a far greater degree than it does upon any piece of theological curiosity: I refer to nutrition.",
  "'How precisely must thou feed thyself in order to attain to thy maximum of power, or virtù in the Renaissance style,—of virtue free from moralic acid?'",
  "Indeed, it is while reading that I recover from my earnestness. During the time that I am deeply absorbed in my work, no books are found within my reach; it would never occur to me to allow any one to speak or even to think in my presence. For that is what reading would mean.",
  "The periods of work and fruitfulness are followed by periods of recuperation.",
  "The sceptics!-the only honourable types among that double-faced and sometimes quintuple-faced throng, the philosophers!",
  "I almost always take refuge in the same books: altogether their number is small; they are books which are precisely my proper fare. It is not perhaps in my nature to read much, and of all sorts: a library makes me ill.",
  "Neither is it my nature to love much or many kinds of things. Suspicion or even hostility towards new books is much more akin to my instinctive feeling than 'toleration,' largeur de cœur, and other forms of 'neighbour-love.'",
  "I believe only in French culture, and regard everything else in Europe which calls itself 'culture' as a misunderstanding. I do not even take the German kind into consideration.",
  "The few instances of higher culture with which I have met in Germany were all French in their origin. The most striking example of this was Madame Cosima Wagner, by far the most decisive voice in matters of taste that I have ever heard.",
  "If I do not read, but literally love Pascal, as the most instinctive sacrifice to Christianity, killing himself inch by inch, first bodily, then spiritually, according to the terrible consistency of this most appalling form of inhuman cruelty",
  "If I have something of Montaigne's mischievousness in my soul, and-who knows?-perhaps also in my body",
  "If my artist's taste endeavours to defend the names of Molière, Corneille, and Racine, and not without bitterness, against such a wild genius as Shakespeare-all this does not prevent me from regarding even the latter-day Frenchmen also as charming companions.",
  "I can think of absolutely no century in history, in which a netful of more inquisitive and at the same time more subtle psychologists could be drawn up together than in the Paris of the present day.",
  "Without that divine wickedness, without which perfection itself becomes unthinkable to me,-I estimate the value of men, of races, according to the extent to which they are unable to conceive of a god who has not a dash of the satyr in him.",
  "One day it will be said of Heine and me that we were by far the greatest artists of the German language that have ever existed, and that we left all the efforts that mere Germans made in this language an incalculable distance behind us.",
  "I must be profoundly related to Byron's Manfred: of all the dark abysses in this work I found the counterparts in my own soul-at the age of thirteen I was ripe for this book.",
  "Words fail me, I have only a look, for those who dare to utter the name of Faust in the presence of Manfred.",
  "The Germans are incapable of conceiving anything sublime: for a proof of this, look at Schumann!",
  "When I cast about me for my highest formula of Shakespeare, I find invariably but this one: that he conceived the type of Cæsar. Such things a man cannot guess-he either is the thing, or he is not.",
  "The great poet draws his creations only from out of his own reality. This is so to such an extent, that often after a lapse of time he can no longer endure his own work.",
  "Let the critics go to hell!",
  "The most exceptional of my readers I should like to say just one word about what I really exact from music. (It must be cheerful and yet profound, like an October afternoon. It must be original, exuberant, and tender, and like a dainty, soft woman in roguishness and grace.)",
  "If I try to find a new word for music, I can never find any other than Venice.",
  "The instinct of self-preservation bids one determine those conditions under which one feels one's self most perfectly at liberty to employ one's strength and one's virtù, and to guard against any encroachment upon these conditions.",
  "My wisdom consists in trying to react as seldom as possible, and to keep one's self aloof from those circumstances and conditions wherein one would be condemned, as it were, to suspend one's 'liberty' and one's initiative, and become a mere reacting medium.",
  "The scholar who, in sooth, does little else than handle books-with the philologist of average attainments their number may amount to two hundred a day-ultimately forgets entirely and completely the capacity of thinking for himself.",
  "When he has not a book between his fingers he cannot think. When he thinks, he responds to a stimulus (a thought he has read),—finally all he does is to react. The scholar exhausts his whole strength in saying either 'yes' or 'no' to matter which has already been thought out, or in criticising it: he is no longer capable of thought on his own account. . . . In him the instinct of self-defence has decayed, otherwise he would defend himself against books. The scholar is a decadent.",
  "With my own eyes I have seen gifted, richly endowed, and free-spirited natures already 'read to ruins' at thirty, and mere wax vestas that have to be rubbed before they can give off any sparks-or 'thoughts.'",
  "To set to early in the morning, at the break of day, in all the fulness and dawn of one's strength, and to read a book-this I call positively vicious!",
  "At this point I can no longer evade a direct answer to the question, how one becomes what one is.",
  "amor fati: the fact that a man wishes nothing to be different, either in front of him or behind him, or for all eternity. Not only must the necessary be borne, and on no account concealed,—all idealism is falsehood in the face of necessity,—but it must also be loved.",
  "I am one thing, my creations are another.",
  "Here, before I speak of the books themselves, I shall touch upon the question of the understanding and misunderstanding with which they have met.",
  "To repeat what I have already said, I can point to but few instances of ill-will in my life and as for literary ill-will, I could mention scarcely a single example of it. On the other hand, I have met with far too much pure foolery!",
  "It seems to me that to take up one of my books is one of the rarest honours that a man can pay himself-even supposing that he put his shoes from off his feet beforehand, not to mention boots.",
  "When on one occasion Dr. Heinrich von Stein honestly complained that he could not understand a word of my Zarathustra, I said to him that this was just as it should be: to have understood six sentences in that book-that is to say, to have lived them-raises a man to a higher level among mortals than 'modern' men can attain.",
  "My triumph is just the opposite of what Schopenhauer's was-I say 'Non legor, non legar.'",
  "As late as last summer, at a time when I was attempting, perhaps by means of my weighty, all-too-weighty literature, to throw the rest of literature off its balance, a certain professor of Berlin University kindly gave me to understand that I ought really to make use of a different form: no one could read such stuff as I wrote.",
  "Switzerland that presented me with the two most extreme cases. An essay on Beyond Good and Evil, by Dr. V. Widmann in the paper called the Bund, under the heading 'Nietzsche's Dangerous Book,' and a general account of all my works, from the pen of Herr Karl Spitteler, also in the Bund, constitute a maximum in my life",
  "The latter treated my Zarathustra, for instance, as 'advanced exercises in style,' and expressed the wish that later on I might try and attend to the question of substance as well",
  "The word 'Superman,' as opposed to 'modern' men, to 'good' men, to Christians and other Nihilists, a word which in the mouth of Zarathustra, the annihilator of morality, acquires a very profound meaning, is understood almost everywhere, and with perfect innocence, in the light of those values to which a flat contradiction was made manifest in the figure of Zarathustra-that is to say, as an 'ideal' type, a higher kind of man, half 'saint' and half 'genius.'",
  "Other learned cattle have suspected me of Darwinism on account of this word",
  "The 'hero cult' of that great unconscious and involuntary swindler, Carlyle,-a cult which I repudiated with such roguish malice, was recognised in my doctrine.",
  "Once, when I whispered to a man that he would do better to seek for the Superman in a Cæsar Borgia than in a Parsifal, he could not believe his ears.",
  "The fact that I am quite free from curiosity in regard to criticisms of my books, more particularly when they appear in newspapers, will have to be forgiven me.",
  "Everywhere else I have my readers-all of them exceptionally intelligent men, characters that have won their spurs and that have been reared in high offices and superior duties; I have even real geniuses among my readers. In Vienna, in St. Petersburg,",
  "It is not in vain that the Poles are considered as the French among the Slavs.",
  "A charming Russian lady will not be mistaken for a single moment concerning my origin. I am not successful at being pompous, the most I can do is to appear embarrassed. . . . I can think in German, I can feel in German-I can do most things; but this is beyond my powers",
  "My old master Ritschl went so far as to declare that I planned even my philological treatises after the manner of a Parisian novelist: that I made them absurdly thrilling.",
  "In Paris itself people are surprised at 'toutes mes audaces et finesses';-the words are Monsieur Taine's",
  "I fear that even in the highest forms of the dithyramb, that salt will be found pervading my work which never becomes insipid, which never becomes 'German'—and that is, wit.",
  "God help me! Amen.—We all know, that the reading of my works 'spoils' a man's taste.",
  "Other books simply cannot be endured after mine, and least of all philosophical ones.",
  "It is an incomparable distinction to cross the threshold of this noble and subtle world-in order to do so one must certainly not be a German; it is, in short, a distinction which one must have deserved.",
  "He, however, who is related to me through loftiness of will, experiences genuine raptures of understanding in my books: for I swoop down from heights into which no bird has ever soared; I know abysses into which no foot has ever slipped.",
  "People have told me that it is impossible to lay down a book of mine: that I disturb even the night's rest.",
  "There is no prouder or at the same time more subtle kind of books: they sometimes attain to the highest pinnacle of earthly endeavour, cynicism; to capture their thoughts a man must have the tenderest fingers as well as the most intrepid fists.",
  "Those who will have nothing to do with the contents of my books, as for instance my so-called friends, assume an 'impersonal' tone concerning them: they wish me luck, and congratulate me for having produced another work; they also declare that my writings show progress, because they exhale a more cheerful spirit.",
  "The thoroughly vicious people, the 'beautiful souls,' the false from top to toe, do not know in the least what to do with my books-consequently, with the beautiful consistency of all beautiful souls, they regard my work as beneath them.",
  "'Feminism,' whether in mankind or in man, is likewise a barrier to my writings; with it, no one could ever enter into this labyrinth of fearless knowledge. To this end, a man must never have spared himself, he must",
  "All this takes for granted, of course, that there exist ears that can hear, and such men as are capable and worthy of a like pathos, that those are not wanting unto whom one may communicate one's self.",
  "Meanwhile my Zarathustra, for instance, is still in quest of such people—alas! he will have to seek a long while yet! A man must be worthy of listening to him. . . .. . And, until that time, there will be no one who will understand the art that has been squandered in this book.",
  "The fact that the voice which speaks in my works is that of a psychologist who has not his peer, is perhaps the first conclusion at which a good reader will arrive: a reader such as I deserve, and one who reads me just as the good old philologists used to read their Horace.",
  "Morality, the Circe of mankind, has falsified everything psychological, root and branch-it has bemoralised everything, even to the terribly nonsensical point of calling love 'unselfish.' A man must first be firmly poised, he must stand securely on his two legs, otherwise he cannot love at all.",
  "May I venture to suggest, incidentally, that I know women? This knowledge is part of my Dionysian patrimony. Who knows? maybe I am the first psychologist of the eternally feminine. Women all like me. . . .",
  "'the essential crime against Life is stupiditas . . . I have discovered that our 'good,' our 'bad,' our 'beautiful,' and our 'ugly' are all the outcome of man's optical necessities. Man himself they preserve, together with the type 'man.' Their utility proves nothing to the contrary. It would be madness to wish to prove anything by these means. All that psychologists have hitherto regarded as the underlying basis of the soul is nothing but the surface,—a mere mask; a man could even conceal himself behind a word. This' impure' has been the essential form of the superiority of happier, stronger types of men; the danger of their lives, their joy. To reduce man by means of morality to a mere instrument of some sort of communal utility, or ultimate foolery ; to desire to graft upon man, with the intention of subsequently regarding it as his very essence, another man's morality, a merely mediocre morality: all this has been an attempt to castrate man at the very root, and the most profound form of immorality that could ever be devised. Only when the 'impure' has been traced down, slandered, and dragged into the mud, has the 'pure'—in the sense of 'holy'—been able to make its appearance. The mob of hypocrites, and those whose souls are in a state of internal discord, always have a need of the pure. They have need of it, because they cannot do without it. The word 'impure,' with which alone the mob brands the 'nobler' nature, merely betrays their impotence:—they cannot endure it, they are compelled to deny it, they require a God who will sanction their views. . . . They have never understood the cheerfulness and high spirits which, almost everywhere and almost spontaneously, are the outcome of a 'good conscience,'—the good conscience which alone enjoys the soul's self-sufficiency and says 'Yea' to its own past and future. In their powerlessness they can only hate this kind of 'good conscience.' To find the evil principle where alone superior, rising life is to be found—and to brand it by means of the concept 'impure,' is the essential crime against Life is the essential crime against the Holy Spirit of Life.'",
  "Tragedy itself is the proof of the fact that the Greeks were not pessimists: Schopenhauer blundered here as he blundered in everything else.",
  "Regarded impartially, The Birth of Tragedy is a book quite strange to its age: no one would dream that it was begun in the thunder of the battle of Wörth. I thought out these problems on cold September nights beneath the walls of Metz, in the midst of my duties as nurse to the wounded; it would be easier to think that it was written fifty years earlier.",
  "The two decisive innovations in the book are, first, the comprehension of the Dionysian phenomenon among the Greeks-it provides the first psychological analysis of this phenomenon, and sees in it the single root of all Greek art; and, secondly, the comprehension of Socraticism-Socrates being presented for the first time as the instrument of Greek dissolution, as a typical decadent.",
  "'Reason versus Instinct.' 'Reason' at any cost, as a dangerous, life-undermining force. The whole book is profoundly and politely silent concerning Christianity: the latter is neither Apollonian nor Dionysian; it denies all",
  "The will to life rejoicing at its own infinite vitality in the sacrifice of its highest types-that is what I called Dionysian, that is what I meant as the bridge to the psychology of the tragic poet.",
  "Not to cast out terror and pity, or to purge one's self of dangerous passion by discharging it with vehemence, this was Aristotle's misunderstanding of it, but to be far beyond terror and pity and to be the eternal lust of Becoming itself-that lust which also involves the joy of destruction.' In this sense I have the right to regard myself as the first tragic philosopher—that is to say, the most extreme antithesis and antipodes of a pessimistic philosopher.",
  "Before my time no such thing existed as this translation of the Dionysian phenomenon into philosophic emotion: tragic wisdom was lacking; in vain have I sought for signs of it even among the great Greeks in philosophy-those belonging to the two centuries before Socrates.",
  "A tremendous hope finds expression in this work. After all, I have absolutely no reason to renounce the hope for a Dionysian future of music.",
  "Let us look a century ahead, and let us suppose that my attempt to destroy two millenniums of hostility to Nature and humanity may succeed.",
  "In all its decisive psychological passages [in the essay Wagner in Bayreuth] I am the only person concerned: without any hesitation you may read my name or the word 'Zarathustra' wherever the text contains the name of Wagner.",
  "The whole panorama of the dithyrambic artist is the representation of the already existing author of Zarathustra, and it is drawn with an abysmal depth which does not even once come into contact with the real Wagner.",
  "'the idea of Bayreuth' was changed into something which to those who are acquainted with my Zarathustra will be no riddle-that is to say, into the Great Noon when the highest of the elect will consecrate themselves for the greatest of all duties—who knows? the vision of a feast which I may live to see.'",
  "Even from the psychological standpoint, all the decisive traits in my character are introduced into Wagner's nature-the juxtaposition of the most brilliant and most fatal forces, a Will to Power such as no man has ever possessed-inexorable bravery in matters spiritual, an unlimited power of learning unaccompanied by depressed powers for action.",
  "Everything in this essay is a prophecy: the proximity of the resurrection of the Greek spirit, the need of men who will be counter-Alexanders, who will once more tie the Gordian knot of Greek culture, after it has been cut.",
  "The four essays composing the Thoughts out of Season are thoroughly warlike in tone. They prove that I was no mere dreamer, that I delight in drawing the sword—and perhaps, also, that my wrist is dangerously supple.",
  "The first onslaught (1873) was directed against German culture, upon which I looked down even at that time with unmitigated contempt. Without either sense, substance, or goal, it was simply 'public opinion.'",
  "There could be no more dangerous misunderstanding than to suppose that Germany's success",
  "Besides confirming my standpoint, he laid even greater stress upon what I had dared to say about the deterioration of language in Germany (nowadays writers assume the airs of Purists * and can no longer even construct a sentence); sharing my contempt for the literary stars of this nation,",
  "At bottom all I had done was to put one of Stendhal's maxims into practice: he advises one to make one's entrance into society by means of a duel.",
  "Up to the present nothing has been more strange and more foreign to my blood than the whole of that European and American species known as libres penseurs. Incorrigible blockheads and clowns of",
  "Plato made use of Socrates in the same way—that is to say, as a cipher for Plato. Now that, from some distance, I can look back upon the conditions of which these essays are the testimony, I would be loth to deny that they refer simply to me. The essay Wagner in Bayreuth is a vision of my own future; on the other hand, my most secret history, my development, is written down in Schopenhauer as Educator.",
  "As to what I understand by being a philosopher,—that is to say, a terrible explosive in the presence of which everything is in danger; as to how I sever my idea of the philosopher by miles from that other idea of him which includes even a Kant, not to speak of the academic 'ruminators' and other professors of philosophy,—concerning all these things this essay provides invaluable information,",
  "My wisdom consists in my having been many things, and in many places, in order to become one thing-in order to be able to attain to one thing. It was part of my fate to be a scholar for a while.",
  "Human, all-too-Human, with its two sequels, is the memorial of a crisis. It is called a book for free spirits: almost every sentence in it is the expression of a triumph-by means of it I purged myself of everything in me which was foreign to my nature.",
  "Idealism is foreign to me: the title of the book means: 'Where ye see ideal things I see-human, alas! all-too-human things!' ... I know men better.",
  "The word 'free spirit' in this book must not be understood as anything else than a spirit that has become free, that has once more taken possession of itself.",
  "My tone, the pitch of my voice, has completely changed; the book will be thought clever, cool, and at times both hard and scornful.",
  "For Voltaire, as the opposite of every one who wrote after him, was above all a grandee of the intellect: precisely what I am also. The name of Voltaire on one of my writings—that was verily a step forward-in my direction.",
  "Looking into this book a little more closely, you perceive a pitiless spirit who",
  "Here, for instance, 'genius' freezes; round the corner the 'saint' freezes; under a thick icicle the 'hero' freezes; and in the end 'faith' itself freezes.",
  "So-called 'conviction' and also 'pity' are considerably cooled-and almost everywhere the 'thing in itself' is freezing to death.",
  "This book was begun during the first musical festival at Bayreuth; a feeling of profound strangeness towards everything that surrounded me there, is one of its first conditions.",
  "What had happened?-Wagner had been translated into German! The Wagnerite had become master of Wagner!-German art! the German master! German beer!",
  "We who know only too well the kind of refined artists and cosmopolitanism in taste, to which alone Wagner's art can appeal, were beside ourselves at the sight of Wagner bedecked with German virtues.",
  "My kingdom for just one intelligent word!-In very truth, a blood-curdling company! Nohl, Pohl, and Kohl,* and others of their kidney to infinity! There was not a single abortion that was lacking among them-no, not even the anti-Semite.-Poor Wagner! Into whose hands had he fallen? If only he had gone into a herd of swine! But among Germans!",
  "In the middle of the festivities I suddenly packed my trunk and left the place for a few weeks, despite the fact that a charming Parisian lady sought to comfort me; I excused myself to Wagner simply by means of a fatalistic telegram.",
  "My melancholy and my contempt of Germans about with me like an illness-and, from time to time, under the general title of 'The Ploughshare,' I wrote a sentence or two down in my note-book, nothing but severe psychological stuff",
  "Human, all-too-Human, this monument of a course of vigorous self-discipline, by means of which I put an abrupt end to all the 'Superior Bunkum,' 'Idealism,' 'Beautiful Feelings,' and other effeminacies that had percolated into my being, was written principally in Sorrento; it was finished and given definite shape during a winter at Bâle, under conditions far less favourable than those in Sorrento.",
  "With this book I open my campaign against morality. Not that it is at all redolent of powder-you will find quite other and much nicer smells in it, provided"
